# DAO POP Contracts

DAO POP is a token launch mechanism by DAOBase. It allows creators to fairly issue tokens via a bonding curve or fixed fundraising model.

## Intro

DAO POP Contracts provide an innovative approach to token issuance, allowing creators to launch their tokens using two main models: the **Bonding Curve** and **Fixed Fundraising**. This mechanism ensures fairness during the token sale process, while offering creators long-term incentives such as ETH and liquidity provider (LP) fees.

## Features

- **Exponential Bonding Curve**: An exponential bonding curve that provides auto liquidity, adjusting to market demand.
- **Fundraising Framework**: A complete fundraising framework that supports treasury management and helps creators raise funds efficiently.
- **Treasury Support**: Integrated treasury management functionality for creators to manage their funds easily.
- **LP Creation**: Automatic liquidity pool creation, supporting token and ETH liquidity provisioning.
- **Fair Launch Mechanism**: A decentralized, fair launch mechanism that ensures a balanced benefit for both creators and investors.
